# Identifying-Fradulent-insurence-claims-Using-Logistic-Regeresion
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using a supervised machine learning approach Logistic Regression. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a claim is likely to be fraudulent based on various features in the dataset.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using **Logistic Regression** to estimate Insurance fraud is a significant challenge for insurance companies, leading to financial losses and increased premiums for policyholders.
This project aims to develop a system that can identify fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning and data analysis techniques and key influencing factors such as **Claim_ID,Claim_Amount, Claim_Type,Policy_Holder_Age,Policy_Duration_Years,Number_of_Claims,Fraudulent**.The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as **classification,Accuracy and R²**.
